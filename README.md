This project implements a digital communication system component designed to resolve phase ambiguity in Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) signals. Phase ambiguity is a common issue in QPSK systems where a receiver's carrier recovery loop may lock onto one of four possible phase states, leading to incorrect symbol interpretation.
